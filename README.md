# from-object-to-data-project
Repository with the files for the project for 'digitzation; from object to data'. 
This repository consists of three files, the project report, the documentation of the dataset and the dataset itself.
The project report is an paper about the dataset and the question "In which type of industry did the greenhouse emissions grow the fastest between 1990 and 2016 and how can this be explained?".
The documentation of the dataset is about how we assessed the dataset and the changes we have made.
The dataset itself can be found inside a zip-file because it was too big to enter in Github without making it a zip.
